# Endwise plugin for Lite XL editor

Plugin that provides automatic adding of words to end block of codes. (Ex. Ruby if ... end or do ... end syntax)

To use it copy __endwise/__ directory to your plugins folder

## Features
  * Add end for diffrent languages
  * Allow to create new rules in Your init.lua file
  * Enable only for languages You want it to work

## Examples

### Simple config to start given language
```lua
local config = require "core.config"

config.plugins.endwise.enable("Ruby")
```
### Add custom rules to languages
```lua
local config = require "core.config"

config.plugins.endwise.add({
  name = "Ruby",
  enabled = true,
  filename = ".rb$",
  addition = "end",
  words = { "module", "class", "def", "if", "unless", "case", "while", "until", "begin", "do" },
  -- :word: is used to substitute for each word from words list
  patterns = { "^%s*(:word:).*$", -- :word: starts the line
               "^%s*%a*%s*(=)%s*(:word:).*$" -- :word: is first word after = sign
  },
  -- excludes are regexp that cannot be matched like for example Ruby3.0 endless method definition
  excludes = { "^%s*(def)%s+%a+%s*(=).*$", -- endless method definition
               "%s+(end)%s*$" -- line ending with end word
  }
})

```

## How it works
Plugin changes the behaviour of __doc:newline__ command. When You start lite-xl with this plugin enabled You will see that in log:
`[INFO] Replacing existing command "doc:newline" at $PATH_TO_LITE_XL/core/command.lua:49`
It attaches new behaviour after original command so it should not break normal behaviour.
